# FunFlix React starter app

This starter repo has been bootstrapped with [Create React
App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## QuickStart

- `BACKEND_URL=https://5e6a7b350f70dd001643be10.mockapi.io/api/v1 npm start` to run the development server (we will give
  you the correct value for `BACKEND_URL` when we meet).
- `npm/yarn test` to run tests.
- Start writing code!
  - Replace the contents of App.js with your own implementation.
  - If you want to add styles, you can use App.css, the `style` prop, or any
    method you wish.
